# CSE330
Student ID: 464850. Link (if you need it?): http://ec2-3-19-70-167.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3456/client.html  Creative portion: for my creative portion, I made a button that allows users to be randomly placed into any chat room that is public, they are not banned from, and they are not currently in. I also implemented some helpful alerts so users can know if they're trying to enter a banned room, they've been kicked out, they're trying to join an unavailable room, they're trying to create a room that already exists, or trying to send a private message to someone not in their room.
